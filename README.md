## 👋 Hello, I'm Amber, FullStack Developer and Chief Technology Officer

### ✨ I'm a mostly self-taught FullStack Developer. <br /><br />
✨ I'm currently working to refactor the MVP for CareHive Maid and Homecare LLC<br />
-- The frontend MVP can be found here: https://care-hive-mvp.vercel.app/<br />
-- I am employing Next.js, Framer Motion for animations, and Swiper.js for carousels. <br />

✨ I'm currently a contributor for three open source projects:<br />
-- Dance Chives, an application to support the breakdancing community<br />
-- Minesweeper 2025, a frontend game built with React<br />
-- BuiltinPublic, a SaaS application for the developer community, built with DevEx in mind<br />

✨ I began learning programming in 2021 via SheCodes.io and Coding Dojo. I've since earned certifications from FreeCodeCamp, Udemy, Scrimba, and TEKSystems via Coursera.<br />
-- I have **four years** of cumulative experience with React.js. I have experience with: Python, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, SQL (mostly PostgreSQL), and unit testing (Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library). My go-to stack is Next or React + Vite with TS and Tailwind.
