## 👋 Hello, I'm Amber.

I began learning to code in 2021. By now, I have honed myself to quickly adapt to the needs of different applications and situations. 

I'm leading a tech stack overhaul at a startup, collaborating on open source, and building solo projects. I'm learning AI, AI dev tools, and agentic features. I generally prefer to use React or Next, but I believe in using the right tool for the circumstance. I have worked professionally with Python. I am looking for ways to pair my automation insights with AI and web dev. 

## About My Work

I handle a bit of everything. I'm an engineer with React and frontend, also fullstack, also with a unique teaching/communications background. I've learned enough from my co-collaborating that I think I can lead a project, and my startup work will prove it.
