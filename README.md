## 👋 Hello, I'm Amber, FullStack Developer and Chief Technology Officer

### ✨ I'm a mostly self-taught FullStack Developer. <br /><br />
✨ I'm currently working to refactor the MVP for CareHive Maid and Homecare LLC<br />
-- The frontend MVP can be found here: https://care-hive-mvp.vercel.app/<br />
-- I am employing Next.js, Framer Motion for animations, and Swiper.js for carousels. <br />

✨ I'm currently a contributor for three open source projects:<br />
-- Dance Chives, an application to support the breakdancing community<br />
-- Minesweeper 2025, a frontend game built with React<br />
-- BuiltinPublic, a SaaS application for the developer community, built with DevEx in mind<br />

✨ I began learning programming in 2021 via SheCodes.io and Coding Dojo. I've since completed certificates from FreeCodeCamp, Udemy, Scrimba, and TEKSystems via Coursera.
