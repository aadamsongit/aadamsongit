## üëã Hello, I'm Amber.

I'm a mostly self-taught developer. From August through December of 2021, I attended Coding Dojo's bootcamp, where I learned to build fullstack applications with Python, React (MERN), and Java with SpringBoot. Through 2022, I continued my studies, obtaining the legacy Responsive Design certification from FreeCodeCamp. I also completed Angela Yu's MERN course via Udemy.

My first big break in tech occurred in early 2023 when I was hired to be part of the Rising Talent IT Automation Team for Takeda Pharmaceuticals, a Fortune 500 global company. I worked there for a year on a contract job. This job ended at the beginning of July, 2024. Since then, I completed my first Scrimba React certification and have spent over half a year building applications and working on open source. 

Since June, I began working at a pre-seed startup. I'm learning a lot about product and startup culture in addition to code. I'm a web developer and I seek to master everything JS, but I'm also learning system design and I seek to be programming agnostic.

**Frameworks:** React.js, Next.js, Vue.js (intermediate), Nuxt.js


## About My Work

I handle a bit of everything. I'm an engineer with React and frontend, also fullstack, also with a unique teaching/communications background. I've learned enough from my co-collaborating that I think I can lead a project, and my startup work will prove it.
