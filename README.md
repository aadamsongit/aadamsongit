## üëã Hello, I'm Amber.

I'm a mostly self-taught developer. From August through December of 2021, I attended Coding Dojo's bootcamp, where I learned to build fullstack applications with Python, React (MERN), and Java with SpringBoot. Through 2022, I continued my studies, obtaining the legacy Responsive Design certification from FreeCodeCamp. I also completed Angela Yu's MERN course via Udemy.

My first big break in tech occurred in early 2023 when I was hired to be part of the Rising Talent IT Automation Team for Takeda Pharmaceuticals, a Fortune 500 global company. I worked there for a year on a contract job. This job ended at the beginning of July, 2024. Since then, I completed my first Scrimba React certification and have spent over half a year building applications and working on open source. 

I'm leading a tech stack overhaul at a startup, collaborating on open source, and building solo projects. I'm learning AI, AI dev tools, and agentic features. I generally prefer to use React or Next, but I believe in using the right tool for the circumstance. I have worked professionally with Python. I am looking for ways to pair my automation insights with AI and web dev. 

## About My Work

I handle a bit of everything. I'm an engineer with React and frontend, also fullstack, also with a unique teaching/communications background. I've learned enough from my co-collaborating that I think I can lead a project, and my startup work will prove it.
